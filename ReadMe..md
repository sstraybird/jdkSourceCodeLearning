## uml: sequence diagram
Here I will embed PlantUML markup to generate a sequence diagram.

I can include as many plantuml segments as I want in my Markdown, and the diagrams can be of any type supported by PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
abstract        abstract
abstract class  "abstract class"
annotation      annotation
circle          circle
()              circle_short_form
class           class
class           class_stereo  <<stereotype>>
diamond         diamond
<>              diamond_short_form
